nxt-decompiled
==============

This is a decompiled version of the official nxt reference client NRS.

http://www.nxtcrypto.org/

https://bitbucket.org/JeanLucPicard/nxt-public/src

There are some false positives when looking at the diffs because the decompiler is changing the order of incremental variable names.

If you'd like to donate some nxt, I may be motivated to keep it updated with each release :)
