nxt-decompiled
==============

This is a decompiled version of the official nxt reference client NRS.

http://www.nxtcrypto.org/

https://bitbucket.org/JeanLucPicard/nxt-public/src

The nested classes have been split out into separate files to reduce the size of the nxt.java and make it a little more readable.

As a result this code will probably not compile.  It is mainly for change tracking.

If you'd like to donate some nxt, I may be motivated to keep it updated with each release :)
